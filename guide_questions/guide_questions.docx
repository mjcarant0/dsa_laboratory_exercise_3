17. How does a linked list manage memory differently from arrays?

A linked list manages memory differently from arrays that makes them more efficient. Here's how:

• A linked list uses dynamic memory allocation, while an array uses a fixed memory block.

• Each node in a linked list is allocated separately and can be stored anywhere in memory.

• Nodes are connected by pointers, allowing the list to grow or shrink easily during runtime.

• Arrays require continuous memory, which can make resizing or inserting elements less efficient.

• Linked lists provide better memory flexibility, while arrays offer faster access due to direct indexing.
