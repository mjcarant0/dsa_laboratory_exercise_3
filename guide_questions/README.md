## Guide Questions

### 1. **What are the advantages of using a linked list over an array?**
- A linked list offers several advantages over an array. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require a fixed size, allowing them to grow or shrink dynamically as needed, which makes them more memory-efficient when the size of the data is unpredictable. Additionally, linked lists make it easier to insert or delete elements, as these operations do not require shifting elements like in arrays. Instead, you simply update the pointers of the nodes. This flexibility makes linked lists particularly useful for applications where frequent insertions and deletions are required. However, it is important to note that accessing elements in a linked list is slower compared to arrays, as you need to traverse the list sequentially to reach a specific element.
